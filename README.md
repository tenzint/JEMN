# JEMN
JWT authentication system; Express.js; MongoDB; Node - A simple tutorial in JWT authentication system (Different from AdonisJS JWT I'm familiar with previously)

# Features / Dependencies

- expressJS framework with 'express-validator' and 'body-parser' dependencies

- Mongoose with MongoDB set up locally on computer through the community edition. Remember to set the C::\data folder on disc for MongoDB

- 'bcryptjs' dependency for salting password. It's an off-the-shelf library, so it's useful.

- 'jsonwebtoken' - the JWT is here.

# Challenges faced

1. Nothing much. Concepts are known previously. Testing with Postman is simple due to prior experience.
